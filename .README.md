### Introduction

### Instructions

## Setting up your local repo

# Clone the remote repo from GitHub

1. Once you've created a local folder from where you intend to run the app, initialise it as a GIT repo using `git init`. Next,
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/CraigAT1181/be-agrarian-flask.git` into the terminal.

# Create a virtual environment

3. In the terminal, type the command `python3 -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment called venv, then
4. Access the virtual environment with the command `source .venv/bin/activate`.

# Install pre-requisite packages

5. Once in the venv, in the terminal, type the command `python -r install requirements.txt`.

# Create local files unavailable from GitHub repo

6. We need 3 files that were not pulled from GitHub. In the terminal, type the following 3 commands:

   - `touch .env`
   - `touch .flaskenv`
   - `touch db/database.ini`

7. In the '.env' file, copy/paste the following text:

   `PGDATABASE=agrarian_test`

8. In the '.flaskenv' file, copy/paste the following text:

   `FLASK_APP=api.py`
   `FLASK_ENV=development`
   `FLASK_DEBUG=True`

9. In the 'database.ini' file, copy/paste the following text:

   `[postgresql]`
   `host=localhost`
   `database=agrarian_test`

# Running the application

10. In the terminal, enter `flask run`.
11. `Ctrl + click` on the localhost address (http://127.0.0.1:5000) to open up a browser.

## Testing

12. While the application is running (using the `flask run` command), type into the terminal `pytest`.
